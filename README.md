Shift Fuzzer
============


## About

This module provides a fuzzer for a [Shift format](https://github.com/shapesecurity/shift-spec) AST.


## Status

[Stable](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index).


## Installation

```sh
npm install shift-fuzzer
```


## Usage

```js
import fuzzProgram, {FuzzerState, fuzzFunctionDeclaration} from "shift-fuzzer";
import render from "shift-codegen";

// generate random program
let randomProgramAst = fuzzProgram();
let randomProgram = render(randomProgramAst);
console.log(randomProgram);

// generate random FunctionDeclaration
let randomFunctionAst = fuzzFunctionDeclaration(new FuzzerState({maxDepth: 7}));
let randomFunction = render(randomFunctionAst);
console.log(randomFunction);

// generate random program from a seed
const RNG_SEED = 0xBADBE1BE1;
let prng =
  (function(state){
    return function nextGaussian() {
      // implementation left as an exercise for the reader
    };
  }(RNG_SEED));
let seededRandomProgramAst = fuzzProgram(new FuzzerState({rng: prng, maxDepth: 7}));
let seededRandomProgram = render(seededRandomProgramAst);
console.log(seededRandomProgram);
```
